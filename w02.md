Malware is software designed to manipulate and damage computer systems. It does so by accessing the rights of the
executing user of the computer systems. Malwares can be injected through various things like files, softwares or websites.

2. [Denial of Service Attack](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-denial-of-service-attack-dos#:~:text=A%20Denial%2Dof%2DService%20(,information%20that%20triggers%20a%20crash.)<br>
Denial of Service or DoS attack is an attack aimed on distrupting legitimate use of a system of facility. Keep in mind tha its main intention is not to 
exploit or steal your resources.    

3. [Viruses](https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-malware-what-is-a-computer-virus.html#:~:text=In%20more%20technical%20terms%2C%20a,order%20to%20execute%20its%20code.)<br>
Viruses is a nother form of program which manifests itself as fragment of code of a legitimate program. Like a real virus, virus on a computer has the ability to replicate
and infect other programs on your computer.

4. [Port Scanning](https://www.avast.com/en-id/business/resources/what-is-port-scanning#:~:text=Port%20scanning%20is%20a%20method,analyzing%20responses%20to%20identify%20vulnerabilities.)<br>
Port scanner is a way for a hacker to identify the weak points or vulnerabilities inside a system to maybe commit an attack.

5. [Encryption](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/encryption#:~:text=Encryption%20is%20the%20method%20by,encrypted%20data%20is%20called%20ciphertext.)<br>
Encryption is a tool used to send messages securely across a network, as well as protect database data, files and disks from having their contents read by unauthorized entities.

6. [Access Matrix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/access-matrix-in-operating-system/)<br>
There has been many functions of matrix throughout history but one of which is to represent protection as an abstract matrix which is called an access matrix.
Rows on the access matrix represent domains and columns represent objects.

7. [Authentication](http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.3/index.cfm?TopicName=Operating_system_authentication#:~:text=Operating%20system%20(OS)%20authentication%20is,certificates%20in%20the%20user's%20computer.)<br>
Operating system (OS) authentication is a method for identifying an individual user with credentials supplied by the operating system of the user's computer. These credentials can be the OS password or can include digital certificates in the user's computer.

8. [Antivirus](https://antivirus.comodo.com/security/define-antivirus.html#:~:text=Antivirus%20software%20is%20a%20type,%2C%20rootkits%2C%20keyloggers%20and%20such.&text=However%2C%20the%20prime%20objective%20of,and%20remove%20viruses%20once%20detected.)<br>
Antivirus software is a type of program designed and developed to protect computers from malware like viruses, computer worms, spyware, botnets, rootkits, keyloggers and such.

9. [Memory Access Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_protection#:~:text=Memory%20protection%20is%20a%20way,not%20been%20allocated%20to%20it.)<br>
MAC is defined as a system policy that makes even the root user cannot modify (unless the policy explicitly allows modifications or the system is rebooted, usually into an alternate
configuration). The restrictions imposed by MAC policy rules are more powerful
than the capabilities of the root user and can be used to make resources
inaccessible to anyone but their intended owners.

10. [Protection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-protection-in-operating-system/#:~:text=Protection%20refers%20to%20a%20mechanism,such%20as%20directory%20or%20files.)<br>
Protection refers to a mechanism which controls the access of programs, processes, or users to the resources defined by a computer system. We can take protection as a helper to multi programming operating system, so that many users might safely share a common logical name space such as directory or files.
