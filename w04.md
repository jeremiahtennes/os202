# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [32 bit vs. 64 bit operating systems](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/32-bit-vs-64-bit-operating-systems)<br>
What basicaly differs between them is that the 64 bit operating system can compute and process more data at once than its competitor.

2. [Logical and physical address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system)<br>
Logical Address Space is the set of all logical addresses generated by CPU for a program whereas the set of all physical address 
mapped to corresponding logical addresses is called Physical Address Space.

3. [Physical and Logical files](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/physical-and-logical-file-systems)<br>
Physical files contain an actual data while logical files do not contain data.

4. [Virtual Machines in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-machines-in-operating-system)<br>
Virtual Machine abstracts the hardware of our personal computer such as CPU, disk drives, memory, NIC (Network Interface Card) etc.
An example of this is Virtual Box. Virtual Machine is like fake computer system operating on your hardware. It partially uses the hardware of your system (like CPU, RAM, disk space, etc.) but its space is completely separated from your main system.

5. [Types of Virtual Machines](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-virtual-machines)<br>
Surprisingly, there are various types of virtual machines two of which are System Virtual Machine and Process Virtual Machine. 

6. [Virtual Memory in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system)<br>
Virtual Memory is a storage allocation scheme in which secondary memory can be addressed as though it were part of main memory.

7. [Paging in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system)<br>
Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory.

8. [Private vs. Public IP address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-private-and-public-ip-addresses)<br>
Private IP address of a system is the IP address which is used to communicate within the same network while public IP address of a system is the IP address which is used to communicate outside the network.

9. [Public Key Encryption](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/public-key-encryption)<br>
The process of changing the plaintext into the ciphertext is referred to as encryption.
The encryption process consists of an algorithm and a key. The key is a value independent of the plaintext.


10. [Virtual memory vs. Cache memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-virtual-memory-and-cache-memory)<br>
Cache memory increases the accessing speed of CPU while Virtual Memory increases the capacity of main memory.
