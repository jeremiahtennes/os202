# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Memory Compression](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30869/memory-compression)<br>
Memory compression is a memory management technique that reduces 
the size of inactive data in the random access memory (RAM) to free up unused 
space and allow more programs to run at once.

2. [RAM vs. ROM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-access-memory-ram-and-read-only-memory-rom/)<br>
One of which that differentiates RAM and ROM is that RAM is a temporary storage while ROM is permanent.
Check the link for more info about the differences between RAM and ROM.

3. [Paging in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)<br>
Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates 
the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory.

4. [Multilevel Paging in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multilevel-paging-in-operating-system)<br>
Multilevel Paging is a paging scheme which consist of two or more levels 
of page tables in a hierarchical manner.

5. [NUMA](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/NUMA-non-uniform-memory-access)<br>
NUMA (non-uniform memory access) is a method of configuring a cluster of microprocessor in a multiprocessing system so that they can share memory locally, 
improving performance and the ability of the system to be expanded.

6. [Virtual Memory in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system)<br>
Virtual Memory is a storage allocation scheme in which secondary memory can be addressed as though it were part of main memory.

7. [System Programs in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-programs-in-operating-system)<br>
System Programming can be defined as act of building Systems Software using System Programming Languages.

8. [Page Replacement Algorithms in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems)<br>
In an operating system that uses paging for memory management, a page replacement algorithm is needed 
to decide which page needs to be replaced when new page comes in.

9. [Page Fault](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-fault-handling-in-operating-system)<br>
A page fault happens when a running program accesses a memory page that is mapped into the virtual 
address space, but not loaded in physical memory.

10. [Levels of Memory in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/levels-of-memory-in-operating-system)<br>
Memory hierarchy of a computer system it handles differences in speed. “Hierarchy” is a great way to say “order of thinks” 
like top to bottom, fast to slow, most important to least important.
