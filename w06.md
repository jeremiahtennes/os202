# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [CPU Sceduling in OS](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/cpu-scheduling)<br>
CPU scheduling is a process which allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state) due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making full use of CPU. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast and fair.

2. [Process Concept in OS](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_processes)<br>
A process is basically a program in execution. The execution of a process must progress in a sequential fashion.

3. [Multicore Programming](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-multicore-programming)<br>
Multicore programming helps to create concurrent systems for deployment on multicore processor and multiprocessor systems.

4. [Multithreading in OS](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/multithreading)<br>
Multithreading is the ability of a program or an operating system process to manage its use by more than one user at a time and to even manage multiple requests by the same user without having to have multiple copies of the programming running in the computer.

5. [Threads and Concurrency in OS](https://applied-programming.github.io/Operating-Systems-Notes/3-Threads-and-Concurrency/)<br>
Thread is an active entity executing unit of a process.

6. [Multithreading Models in OS](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/multi-threading-models)<br>
The main models for multithreading are one to one model, many to one model and many to many model. 

7. [Process Communication in OS](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-communication-in-operating-system)<br>
Processes that executing concurrently in the operating system may be either independent processes or cooperating processes.

8. [Process Creation vs. Process Termination](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-creation-vs-process-termination-in-operating-system)<br>
Process Creation and Process termination are used to create and terminate processes respectively.

9. [Inter Process Communication](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-process-communication-ipc)<br>
Inter process communication (IPC) is a mechanism which allows processes to communicate with each other and synchronize their actions.

10. [Difference Between Process and Thread](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-process-and-thread)<br>
One of the differences between process and thread is process takes more time to terminate while thread takes less time to terminate. Click the link to get more.
