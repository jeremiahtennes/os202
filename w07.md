# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Process Synchronization](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization)<br>
Process Synchronization means sharing system resources by processes in a such a way that, Concurrent access to shared data is handled thereby minimizing the chance of inconsistent data.

2. [Semaphore in OS](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_processes)<br>
Semaphore was proposed by Dijkstra in 1965 which is a very significant technique to manage concurrent processes by using a simple integer value, which is known as a semaphore.

3. [Binary Semaphore](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/semaphores-in-process-synchronization)<br>
This is also known as mutex lock. It can have only two values – 0 and 1. Its value is initialized to 1.

4. [Counting Semaphore](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/semaphores-in-process-synchronization)<br>
Its value can range over an unrestricted domain. It is used to control access to a resource that has multiple instances.

5. [Mutex vs Semaphore](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mutex-vs-semaphore)<br>
As per operating system terminology, mutex and semaphore are kernel resources that provide synchronization services (also called as synchronization primitives).

6. [OpenMP](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-openmp)<br>
OpenMP is a set of compiler directives as well as an API for programs written in C, C++, or FORTRAN that provides support for parallel programming in shared-memory environments.

7. [Functional Programming](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/functional_programming/functional_programming_introduction)<br>
Functional programming languages are specially designed to handle symbolic computation and list processing applications.

8. [System modeling](https://cs.ccsu.edu/~stan/classes/CS410/Notes16/05-SystemModeling)<br>
System modeling is the process of developing abstract models of a system, with each model presenting a different view or perspective of that system.

9. [Deadlock in multithreading](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Deadlock-in-Java-Multithreading)<br>
Deadlock occurs when multiple threads need the same locks but obtain them in a different order.

10. [Banker’s Algorithm in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bankers-algorithm-in-operating-system-2/)<br>
The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.
