# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [CPU Scheduling in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/)<br>
Scheduling of processes/work is done to finish the work on time.

2. [CPU-I/O Burst Cycle](http://boron.physics.metu.edu.tr/ozdogan/OperatingSystems/week5/node19.html)<br>
Semaphore was proposed by Dijkstra in 1965 which is a very significant technique to manage concurrent processes by using a simple integer value, which is known as a semaphore.

3. [Operating System Scheduling algorithms](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling_algorithms.htm)<br>
A Process Scheduler schedules different processes to be assigned to the CPU based on particular scheduling algorithms.

4. [Linux](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_linux.htm)<br>
Linux is one of popular version of UNIX operating System. It is open source as its source code is freely available.

5. [Tar file](https://www.lifewire.com/tar-file-2622386)<br>
Short for Tape Archive, and sometimes referred to as tarball, a file that has the TAR file extension is a file in the Consolidated Unix Archive format. A program or command that can open archives is needed to open a TAR file.

6. [Tgz file](https://www.winzip.com/win/en/tgz-file.htm)<br>
A TGZ file is a TAR Archive file that has been compressed using Gnu Zip (gzip) software. Commonly used on UNIX and Linux systems, TAR archives bundle a collection of files into a single file for easier distribution or backup.

7. [CPU Scheduling Criteria](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-criteria/)<br>
Different CPU scheduling algorithms have different properties and the choice of a particular algorithm depends on the various factors.

8. [Multiple-Processor Scheduling in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-processor-scheduling-in-operating-system/)<br>
In multiple-processor scheduling multiple CPUâ€™s are available and hence Load Sharing becomes possible. However multiple processor scheduling is more complex as compared to single processor scheduling.

9. [Scheduling in Real Time Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scheduling-in-real-time-systems/)<br>
Real-time systems are systems that carry real-time tasks. These tasks need to be performed immediately with a certain degree of urgency. In particular, these tasks are related to control of certain events (or) reacting to them. Real-time tasks can be classified as hard real-time tasks and soft real-time tasks. 

10. [Operating Systems Evaluation of Scheduling Algorithms](https://www.faceprep.in/operating-systems/operating-systems-evaluation-of-scheduling-algorithms/)<br>
Discusses various techniques to evaluate a particular scheduling algorithm.
