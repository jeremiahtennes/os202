# Top 10 List of Week 09

1. [Hard Drive](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/harddriv.htm#)<br>
A hard disk drive (sometimes abbreviated as a hard drive, HD, or HDD) is a non-volatile data storage device. It is usually installed internally in a computer, attached directly to the disk controller of the computer's motherboard.

2. [Nonvolatile Memory Device](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/nonvolatile-memory)<br>
Non-volatile memory (NVMe) is a semiconductor technology that does not require a continuous power supply to retain the data or program code stored in a computing device.

3. [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/)<br>
GnuPG is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC4880 (also known as PGP).

4. [Volatile Memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-volatile-memory-and-non-volatile-memory/)<br>
It is the memory hardware that fetches/stores data at a high-speed. It is also referred as temporary memory. 

5. [Mapping Virtual Addresses to Physical Addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mapping-virtual-addresses-to-physical-addresses/#)<br>
Address binding is the process of mapping from one address space to another address space. Logical address is address generated by CPU during execution whereas Physical Address refers to location in memory unit(the one that is loaded into memory).

6. [Disk Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/disk-scheduling-algorithms/#)<br>
Disk scheduling is done by operating systems to schedule I/O requests arriving for the disk. Disk scheduling is also known as I/O scheduling.

7. [SCAN (Elevator) Disk Scheduling Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scan-elevator-disk-scheduling-algorithms/?ref=lbp)<br>
In SCAN disk scheduling algorithm, head starts from one end of the disk and moves towards the other end, servicing requests in between one by one and reach the other end. 

8. [C-SCAN Disk Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-scan-disk-scheduling-algorithm/?ref=lbp)<br>
Circular SCAN (C-SCAN) scheduling algorithm is a modified version of SCAN disk scheduling algorithm that deals with the inefficiency of SCAN algorithm by servicing the requests more uniformly.

9. [LOOK Disk Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/look-disk-scheduling-algorithm/?ref=lbp)<br>
LOOK is the advanced version of SCAN (elevator) disk scheduling algorithm which gives slightly better seek time than any other algorithm in the hierarchy (FCFS->SRTF->SCAN->C-SCAN->LOOK).

10. [Disk Attatchment](https://padakuu.com/article/108-disk-attachment#)<br>
Computers access disk storage in two ways. One way is via I/O ports (or host-attached storage); this is common on small systems. The other way is via a remote host in a distributed file system; this is referred to as network-attached storage.
