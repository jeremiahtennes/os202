# Top 10 List of Week 10

1. [Memory mapped I/O and Isolated I/O](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-mapped-i-o-and-isolated-i-o/?ref=lbp)<br>
As a CPU needs to communicate with the various memory and input-output devices (I/O) as we know data between the processor and these devices flow with the help of the system bus.

2. [I/O scheduling in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/i-o-scheduling-in-operating-systems/)<br>
Scheduling is used for efficient usage of computer resources avoiding deadlock and serving all processes waiting in the queue. 

3. [Kernel I/O Subsystem](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_io_software.htm#)<br>
Kernel I/O Subsystem is responsible to provide many services related to I/O. Following are some of the services provided.

4. [Isolated I/O](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-mapped-i-o-and-isolated-i-o/?ref=lbp)<br>
It is the memory hardware that fetches/stores datThen we have Isolated I/O in which we Have common bus(data and address) for I/O and memory but separate read and write control lines for I/O. 

5. [I/O system in operating system](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/13_IOSystems.html)<br>
Management of I/O devices is a very important part of the operating system - so important and so varied that entire I/O subsystems are devoted to its operation. 

6. [Disk Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/disk-scheduling-algorithms/#)<br>
Disk scheduling is done by operating systems to schedule I/O requests arriving for the disk. Disk scheduling is also known as I/O scheduling.

7. [Memory-mapped I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O)<br>
Memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) and port-mapped I/O (PMIO) (which is also called isolated I/O are two complementary methods of performing input/output (I/O) between the central processing unit (CPU) and peripheral devices in a computer. 

8. [Kernel Data Structures](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Kernel-Data-Structures#)<br>
The kernel data structures are very important as they store data about the current state of the system.

9. [I/O Protection](http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hamilton/courses/330/notes/introduction/introduction.html#)<br>
Input/output protection: Input/output is protected by making all input/output instructions privileged. While running in user mode, the CPU cannot execute them; thus, user code, which runs in user mode, cannot execute them.

10. [Virtual memory vs. Cache memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-virtual-memory-and-cache-memory)<br>
Cache memory increases the accessing speed of CPU while Virtual Memory increases the capacity of main memory.
